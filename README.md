# Random square
Random square is a simple game made with Next.js.

## How to play?
- Click on Roll the dice to get a specific number of moves.
- Move using arrow keys.
- You can't move to the opposite direction that you are moving.
- When you go to an `X` square with no moves left, you need to go from the beginning.
- If you react the `W` square with no moves left, you completed the map.
- If you react the `S` square with some moves left, you have to move backwards.

## How to edit? 
- Click on a random square to change the type of square.
- Clicking on the empty square will change it to be a normal square.
- Clicking on the normal square will change it to be an `X` square.
- Clicking on the `X` square will change it to be a `W` square.
- Clicking on the `W` square will change it to be an `S` square.
